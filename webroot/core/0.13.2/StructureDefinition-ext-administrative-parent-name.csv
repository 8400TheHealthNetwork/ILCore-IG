","Ext: Administrative Parent Name","Extension: The name of a person’s parent, recorded for administrative purposes as part of the person’s demographics (e.g to help with identification).

Most systems will use the “father’s name” field as the source of data for this extension. NOTE: This extension replaces the old ParentName extension and is the PREFFERED extension.
